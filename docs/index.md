## About the Framework
***
Our [Framework Summary](framework/architecture) talks to the structure of the project and its core components.

One of the core components, [Applications](framework/applications.md), can be best understood by reading our [Application Walkthrough](framework/app_walkthrough).

There's a [component library](components/basewindow.md) to make building even easier.
