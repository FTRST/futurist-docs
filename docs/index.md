    This documentation (and futurist as a whole) is still in beta.

    Some items may not be up-to-date. A clone of the live site is available on GitHub.

## Migration to Rust
***
This documentation covers the core concepts of which the React framework version was released.

However, this project is being re-written in Rust to handle issues specifically related to concurrency.

The Rust architecture is expected to be similar to the React implementation, albeit with a higher ceiling for scalability, reliance, and speed.

The React version of the framework is still well-suited for a variety of applications. Feel free to read on and try it out!
***
## About the Framework
***
Our [Framework Summary](framework/architecture.md) talks to the structure of the project and its core components.

One of the core components, Applications, can be best understood by reading our [Application Walkthrough](framework/app_walkthrough.md).

There's a [component library](components/basewindow.md) to make building even easier.
