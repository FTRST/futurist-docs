# Quick Start
Per the [Architecture](../framework/architecture), the platform is broken up into three main pieces.

This guide will walk you through setting up a bespoke environment to customize.

If you'd rather have a full project to work backwards from, the [futurist.io](https://futurist.io) site [has its own repo](https://github.com/ftrst/futurist-react).

For better understanding on the project, please (at least) read:

* [Framework Summary](arch/framework_summary) - To understand the roles of each of the parts being set up.
* [Application Walkthrough](arch/app_walkthrough) - For an in-depth walkthrough of an Application, how it works, etc.
